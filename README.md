The Odin Project HTML Recipes Page

Here is my first project for TOP, featuring three recipe pages. All of this was learned from scratch and done in about 4-5 hrs from starting the module to finishing the project, with a few breaks in between. I integrated some CSS in the first published version that I picked up trying to solve a few issues HTML couldn't, and I hope to come back and refresh the design more with what I learn later.
